> ```
> Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
> Output: "BANC"
> Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
> ```

> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "a", t = "a"
> Output: "a"
> Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

> ```
> Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
