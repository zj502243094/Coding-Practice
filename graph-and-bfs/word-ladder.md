# Word Ladder

[https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

> Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
> <strong>Output: 5
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong> One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.</code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
> <strong>Output: 0
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong> The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.</code></pre>
