> You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:
>
> * Every element less than `pivot` appears **before** every element greater than `pivot`.
> * Every element equal to `pivot` appears **in between** the elements less than and greater than `pivot`.
> * The **relative order** of the elements less than `pivot` and the elements greater than `pivot` is maintained.
