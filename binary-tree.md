# Binary Tree

Binary Tree实现

```
/**
 * Definition of TreeNode:
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left, right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = this.right = null;
 *     }

A **full** binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

In a **complete** binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

A **balanced** binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

A **perfect** binary tree is a tree with all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children.
